          <h4>A person who can produce a consistent effort</h4>
          <p>We learn throughout our entire life, so persistent effort is very important. No one should be satisfied with what he or she has. Our business environment is ever-changing, and if we cannot cope with such changes, it is time for us to retire as specialists.</p>

          <span>02</span>
          <h4>A person who is quick in responding to clients</h4>
          <p>The reason why clients ask questions is because they want immediate advice. We must answer the clients’ questions right then and there. For that, it is important to be sufficiently prepared.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0">

          <span>03</span>
          <h4>A person who is quick in taking decisions</h4>
          <p>When people take a long time to make a decision, it means that they are perplexed. It often happens that people take wrong decisions at such times. The appropriateness of a decision is not proportional to the time taken to take said decision. It is very important to take decisions immediately.</p>

          <span>04</span>
          <h4>A person with strategy for work</h4>
          <p>It is very important to have a strategy for any kind of work. If we do not have strategy, we will only get swayed by the work, and we will eventually not be able to achieve anything. We should always set our goals, and decide what we have to do to attain them. We should be aware of the most suitable way of working in the present situation. A person with strategy is a person who can do an excellent job in a short time.</p>

          <span>05</span>
          <h4>A person who can positively face his or her first job</h4>
             <p>Anyone can do work that they are experienced in. The real ability of a person will be tested in his or her first job, and there will also be times when significant improvement will come about. We cannot use inexperience as an excuse. A person who can face his or her first job positively is a person who can develop faster than others.

          <span>06</span>
          <h4> A person who can add value at work</h4>
          <p>We cannot get rewards from work that has no added value. We should take high rewards by giving high added value to our clients. The final evaluation from clients is the reward we get. No matter how well we think we’ve done our job, if we do not get rewards from clients, it means that we could not meet their needs and it becomes nothing more than self-satisfaction.

          <span>07</span>
          <h4>A person who can work enjoyably</h4>
          <p>It is very important to find delight at work. If we cannot find delight, be it in any difficult job, it is just a waste of time, and we end up getting nothing. A person with lots of complaints is definitely not able to do his or her job properly. Among successful people, there are not many who complain. This is because, upon facing difficulty, a successful person immediately thinks of a solution to the problem, instead of complaining.</p>

          <span>08</span>
          <h4>A person who knows his or her position</h4>
          <p>We must be able to analyze our knowledge and level of competency objectively. Further, we should always give 120% at work, compared to the present. We cannot get anything if we work from within the limits of our knowledge and ability. We should objectively analyze whether our present job will help developing our ability further, and must plan out ways to develop our ability.</p>

          <span>09</span>
          <h4> A person who can act differently than others</h4>
          <p>We cannot do an original work just by imitating other people’s way of working. We should discover the originality in ourselves, and in order to develop a product / service, we must think with new ideas and not be stuck with stereotypical ones. We should not be satisfied with the present situation, but instead constantly develop new ways and create new paths.</p>

          <span>10</span>
          <h4>A person with a philosophy for work</h4>
          <p>Can we clearly define what we are working for, and what motives we are living with? People ultimately live either for themselves or for others. People who have the belief, philosophy, and will to live their lives for the sake of others (clients and society) can be said to be the real professionals.</p>
